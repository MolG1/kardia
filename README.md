The code used to train the Word2Vec models used in the bachelor's thesis "Καρδία in the New Testament and Other Ancient Greek Literature; Using a Corpus Approach to Investigate the Semantics of Καρδία Against the Backdrop of New Testament Lexicography".

The stopwords used as well as parts of the code were copied from: https://github.com/lisni946/ijl_greek_kinship_terms

The trained models are found at: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/_in_the_New_Testament_and_Other_Ancient_Greek_Literature_Using_a_Corpus_Approach_to_Investigate_the_Semantics_of_Against_the_Backdrop_of_New_Testament_Lexicography/25852798

The randomized hyperparameter settings for each model are found in "hyperparameters.txt".
